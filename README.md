## Project Summary  
This project was completed as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and focuses on analyzing low-scale crimes in Berlin from 2012 to 2019. The primary aim was to uncover patterns in crime trends, identify correlations between different types of crimes, and determine which districts in Berlin were most affected. Using Python and Excel, the analysis employed a range of techniques, including geospatial, regression, and cluster analysis, to derive actionable insights.  

## Objectives  
- **Trend Analysis**: Determine whether crime rates in Berlin increased or decreased during the study period.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify potential relationships between different types of crimes.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Pinpoint the districts in Berlin most affected by crime.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- **Python Programming**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.  
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping crime data using shapefiles.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression and cluster analysis.  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Examining trends over time.  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Development of an interactive Tableau dashboard to present findings.  

## Tools and Systems Used  
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, and Scikit-learn.  
- **Excel**: Data organization and preprocessing.  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard creation.
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** This dataset was externally sourced from the [Berlin Police](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/), which publish the [“Berlin Crime Atlas”](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/service/kriminalitaetsatlas/) every two years, a report on the small-scale distribution of crime in Berlin. This publicly available data was then collected and curated by Danil Zyryanov on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danilzyryanov/crime-in-berlin-2012-2019/data), who translated the original report and united information pertaining to multiple years in one single dataset (originally, the information was divided by year).
- **Contents:** The dataset contains information about small-scale crime in the city of Berlin, divided by districts and locations, from 2012 to 2019. It has 1200 rows and 20 columns (variables): Year, District, Code, Location, Robbery, Street_robbery, Injury, Agg_assault, Threat, Theft, Car, From_car, Bike, Burglary, Fire, Arson, Damage, Graffiti, Drugs and Local.
- **Data Size:** 124.093 bytes.
